I'm a digital hardware designer by day, unfocused dabbler by night. Latest interests include retro
computer tech, reverse-engineering, and emulation. Some other areas that occasionaly have my
interest are electronics tinkering, game development, audio production, speedrunning, and generally faffing about.
It's anyone's guess what I'll end up writing about.
